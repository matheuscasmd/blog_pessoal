This build shines as a refreshing option, combining projectile damage, fire damage, and Fire Avatar to enhance spell combos with Fireball.

### Overview

The main interaction of this build, compared to more traditional magic-focused classes, is the abundance of fire damage passives near the beginning of the character's skill tree. Additionally, with the new Gemling Ascendancy passives, it becomes even more viable to invest heavily in INT while maintaining at least 100 STR.

### Clearing

Using the Fireball and Snap spells, you can apply multiple fire infusions and launch empowered fireballs almost continuously, especially when factoring in support gems and Spirit-based modifiers related to infusions.

### Bosses

Boss fights rely heavily on the Lightning Orb combo to generate lightning infusions, along with Mana Tempest and Ember Fusillade. The lightning infusion deals massive damage, but be careful when standing inside buff zones, as you become more vulnerable there.
